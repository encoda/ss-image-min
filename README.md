# SilverStripe Image Minify Module

SS-image-min is a Silverstripe module for image compressing and server-side caching based on [nielse63/php-image-cache](https://github.com/nielse63/php-image-cache).

## Requirements

Tested on SilverStrip 3.1

## Instalation
After installing the module by any of the following methods you must buid you database by visiting http://yoursite.com/dev/build.

### Composer
Soon....

### Github
Navigate to the root directory of your SilverStripe application and execute `git clone https://github.com/encoda/ss-image-min.git`

### Manually
Download [this zip file](https://github.com/encoda/ss-image-min/zipball/master) and extract it in your SilverStripe root directory.

## Usage

Once the module is installed, a compressed cache version of each Silverstripe `Image` instance file is automatically generated by the time it is saved in the database, or (if the module is lately installed in the application and there are already several images in the database) individually at the moment the URL of any of them is called directly or indirectly, by calling either one of its following methods: `getTag`, `getUrl` or `getAbsoluteURL`.

### Example

mysite/code/NarcissisticTeenager.php

``` php
<?php

NarcissisticTeenager extends DataObject {
    ...
    private static $many_many = array(
        'Selfies' => 'Image',
    );

    public function FirstSelfie() {
        return $this->Selfies()->First();
    }
    ...
}
```

themes/autinpack/templates/Page.ss

``` ss
<% with $SomeNarcissisticTeenager %>
    <% loop $Selfies %>
        $GetTag
    <% end_loop %>
<% end_with %>
```

## Configuration

SS-image-min doesn't require any configuration.
Although you can overwrite some of them through your `_config.php`.

### Compress Rate
**Default:** `80`
```
<?php
SSImageCache::$compress_rate = 70;
```

## Tasks

If you want to manually generate the compreessed cache version of all your `Image` instances instead of waiting for them to be automatically and individually generated, just access [http://yoursite/dev/tasks/CacheImageTask](yoursite/tasks/CacheImageTask) and wait until it finishes the process.

## Troubleshooting

If you experiment terrible white screens of death after installing the module, your server might be running out of memory while trying to create several compressed cache image files at once.
Try out increasing your server's memory limit in its php.ini file ou simply generate the cache images by running the `CacheImageTask` instead of letting it generate the files automatically.
